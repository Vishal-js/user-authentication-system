This project features a login page where users can authenticate using a specific set of credentials. Upon successful login, the user is redirected to an admin page that includes a tab-based navigation system for viewing different information. Additionally, a forgot password page has been added, allowing users to reset their password by entering their email ID and OTP.

Note: The login flow will only work if you use VS Code with the Live Server extension.
